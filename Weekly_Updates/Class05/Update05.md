# Group 02: Project Update Week 05

## Kazi Safin Arafat 2211778642

I have set up project structure as instructed. Updated README, collected Dataset & pushed to github, reviewed some research papers. I also have started working on datasets cleaning and analyzing. For our case we will use [TON_IoT](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets). I also have setup python environtment in Kaggle. We all will have separate kaggle environtment and then merge all in the github project.

This week, I focused mainly on the literature-review presentation and research papers.I created and organized the Week 05 presentation (PPTX) summarizing our reviewed papers and project structure.
I reviewed four research papers related to machine-learning-based intrusion detection for IoT devices and identified their key gaps for our hybrid model design.
Additionally, I started working with the TON_IoT dataset, checking features and planning preprocessing steps for upcoming experiments.

This week, I focused on reviewing several research papers and came across one titled P. Peisker et al., 'Evaluating Explainable AI for Deep Learning-Based Network Intrusion Detection,” arXiv, 2025. Our project aims to develop an interpretable ML pipeline for zero-day attack detection in IoT environments, while Peisker et al. (2025) evaluate XAI methods such as SHAP and LIME in deep learning–based intrusion detection systems. Their study provides a strong foundation for the explainability and benchmarking aspects of our project. Although their work primarily focuses on known-attack detection, their insights into XAI’s potential for generalising to unseen attacks directly support our objectives. We can leverage their findings as benchmarks for SHAP and LIME on datasets like NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017, and adopt their XAI evaluation metrics — fidelity (accuracy of explanations), stability (consistency across similar samples), and human interpretability (clarity and usefulness of explanations to users).
