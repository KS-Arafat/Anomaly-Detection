## Kazi Safin Arafat 2211778642

I have set up project structure as instructed. Updated README, collected Dataset & pushed to github, reviewed some research papers. I also have started working on datasets cleaning and analyzing. For our case we will use [TON_IoT](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets). I also have setup python environtment in Kaggle. We all will have separate kaggle environtment and then merge all in the github project.

This week, I focused mainly on the literature-review presentation and research papers.I created and organized the Week 05 presentation (PPTX) summarizing our reviewed papers and project structure.
I reviewed four research papers related to machine-learning-based intrusion detection for IoT devices and identified their key gaps for our hybrid model design.
Additionally, I started working with the TON_IoT dataset, checking features and planning preprocessing steps for upcoming experiments.
