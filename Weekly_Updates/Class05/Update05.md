## Kazi Safin Arafat 2211778642

I have set up project structure as instructed. Updated README, collected Dataset & pushed to github, reviewed some research papers. I also have started working on datasets cleaning and analyzing. For our case we will use [TON_IoT](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets). I also have setup python environtment in Kaggle. We all will have separate kaggle environtment and then merge all in the github project.
